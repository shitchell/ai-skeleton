# ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS.md

## 📘 Purpose
This document outlines common architectural patterns and conventions used across this project, providing:
- Recommended approaches for different architectural challenges 
- Design principles that guide system structure
- Standard patterns for component interfaces
- Conventions for module boundaries

---

## 🏛️ Architectural Principles

### 🟩 Loose Coupling
> Components interact through well-defined interfaces with minimal knowledge of each other's implementation details.

**Benefits:**
- Easier to maintain and modify individual components
- Facilitates testing in isolation
- Supports parallel development

---

### 🟩 High Cohesion
> Related functionality is grouped together in the same component or module.

**Benefits:**
- More maintainable and understandable code
- Reduced cognitive load when working on a specific feature
- Natural boundaries for testing and refactoring

---

### 🟩 Separation of Concerns
> Different aspects of functionality are handled by distinct components.

**Common separations:**
- Data access / Business logic / Presentation 
- Configuration / Runtime behavior
- Domain-specific code / Technical infrastructure

## 🔄 Common Patterns

| Pattern                      | Use When                             | Key Benefits                        |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Repository                   | Abstracting data access              | Testability, switching data sources |
| Service Layer                | Encapsulating business logic         | Reusability across entry points     |
| Dependency Injection         | Managing component dependencies      | Configurability, testability        |
| Event-Driven                 | Decoupling components                | Extensibility, async processing     |
| Command Query Responsibility | Separating reads from writes         | Optimization, scalability          |
| Factory                      | Creating families of related objects | Encapsulation of creation logic     |

## 📂 Module Organization

| Layer               | Responsibility                     | Example                                  |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Presentation        | User interaction                  | UI components, API controllers           |
| Application         | Coordinating use cases            | Services, command handlers               |
| Domain              | Core business logic               | Entities, value objects, domain services |
| Infrastructure      | Technical concerns                | Data access, external services           |
