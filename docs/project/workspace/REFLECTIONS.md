# REFLECTIONS.md

## üß† Purpose

This document captures structured reflections on completed features, milestones, and project phases. It serves as a higher-level complement to [LESSONS_LEARNED.md](./LESSONS_LEARNED.md), focusing on broader patterns, process effectiveness, and team dynamics rather than specific technical lessons.

> The goal is to build systematic awareness of what's working well and what isn't, creating a feedback loop for process improvement.

## üìù Reflection Format

When documenting a reflection, use the following structure:

```markdown
## Feature/Milestone: [Name]
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

### What Worked Well
- [Insight about process, approach, or collaboration that was effective]
- [...]

### What Could Be Smoother
- [Challenge, friction point, or inefficiency]
- [...]

### Blind Spots Encountered
- [What assumptions were incorrect]
- [What information was missing]
- [...]

### Value Alignment
- [Where decisions aligned/misaligned with project values]
- [Tensions between competing values]
- [...]

### Preventative Measures
- [How issues could have been avoided]
- [Early indicators we should watch for]
- [...]
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Feature Reflections

[Individual feature reflections will be added here as features are completed, following the format above]

---

## üìä Pattern Recognition

As patterns emerge across multiple reflections, they should be documented here for reference in future planning:

### Common Strengths
- [Common strength patterns across features]

### Common Challenges
- [Recurring challenge patterns]

### Process Improvement Opportunities
- [Identified improvements to development protocols]
