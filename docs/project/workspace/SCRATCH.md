# SCRATCH.md

## 📝 Purpose
This document serves as a temporary holding area for miscellaneous items, observations, questions, or issues that don't fit neatly into other documentation categories. It's a place to capture important thoughts that need to be addressed later without disrupting the current development flow.

---

## 🧠 When to Use SCRATCH.md
- To note process misunderstandings that need later reflection
- To capture ideas that don't yet have a clear home
- To track questions that need answers but aren't blocking current work
- To flag potential improvements that aren't part of the current cycle
- To document observations that might be valuable but need further consideration

---

## 📋 Structure
Entries should follow this format:

```markdown
## Brief descriptive title
Reference: [Source document, e.g., DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md entry date]
Issue/Observation: [Clear description of what was noticed]
Potential resolution: [Initial thoughts if available]
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- SCRATCH.md **must** be reviewed during cycle transitions
- Items should not remain in SCRATCH.md indefinitely
- The goal is to eventually move all items to their appropriate homes in the documentation structure
- Not all items need immediate resolution - some may persist across multiple cycles

<!-- Example:
## Potential misunderstanding about validation requirements
Reference: [DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md](./DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md) (2023-05-15)
Issue: Team seems to have different interpretations of what "validated" means in context of user data
Potential resolution: Create explicit validation criteria document
