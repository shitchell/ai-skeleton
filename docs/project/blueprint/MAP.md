# ğŸ§­ Project Coherence Map (MAP.md)

This document maps high-level goals â†’ use cases â†’ components â†’ tests â†’ deliverables.

It serves as a dependency graph for clarity, traceability, and coherence.

## ğŸ“Œ Structure

```
GOAL: Ensure accurate input validation
  â””â”€â”€ USE_CASE: User enters invalid email
        â””â”€â”€ REQUIREMENT: Email must match RFC standard
              â””â”€â”€ COMPONENT: EmailValidator.js
                    â””â”€â”€ TEST: emailValidator.spec.js
```

> Every node should be traceable back to its parent(s). If a node is undefined or unclear, resolve or mark it as a `flex_point`.
