# 🧭 Project Coherence Map (MAP.md)

This document maps high-level goals → use cases → components → tests → deliverables.

It serves as a dependency graph for clarity, traceability, and coherence.

## 📌 Structure

```
GOAL: Ensure accurate input validation
  └── USE_CASE: User enters invalid email
        └── REQUIREMENT: Email must match RFC standard
              └── COMPONENT: EmailValidator.js
                    └── TEST: emailValidator.spec.js
```

> Every node should be traceable back to its parent(s). If a node is undefined or unclear, resolve or mark it as a [flex_point](./FLEX_POINTS.md).
