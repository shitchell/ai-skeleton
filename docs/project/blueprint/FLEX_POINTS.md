# ðŸ”€ Defined Flex Points

This document lists all known unresolved or intentionally undefined areas of the project map.
These represent either future extensibility OR risk of incoherence.

Each entry must include:

1. **Why was this left undefined?**
2. **Possible coherent branches** (anticipated extensions or forks)
3. **Possible decoherence** (contradictions or integration issues)
4. **Risk level** (low/med/high)
5. **When will this need to be resolved?**
