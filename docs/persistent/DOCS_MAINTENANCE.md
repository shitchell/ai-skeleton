# DOCS_MAINTENANCE.md

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose
This file describes how documentation is maintained, pruned, and migrated across the lifecycle of development.

---

## ðŸ§½ Pruning Guidelines
- Use the tag `<!-- prune-needed -->` in any file where outdated, redundant, or resolved information exists
- AI assistants are encouraged to emit pruning tags when they:
  - Repeat information already documented
  - Change direction mid-design
  - Migrate content into a more canonical location

---

## ðŸªµ Prune Triggers
- After each feature completion â†’ run through [CYCLE_END_OF_FEATURE.md](./CYCLE_END_OF_FEATURE.md)
- After a full build passes â†’ prune stale notes, diagrams, exploratory logs
- Before starting a new major feature or rewrite

---

## ðŸ“š What Goes Where
- **PROJECT_SPECS.md** â†’ long-term identity and intent
- **DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md** â†’ chronological scratchpad of session plans and outputs
- **LESSONS_LEARNED.md** â†’ postmortems and generalized takeaways
- **DESIGN_DECISIONS.md** â†’ architecture commitments and rationale
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** â†’ evolving plan for whatâ€™s coming next

---

## ðŸ—ƒ Archive Strategy
Move stale or unused materials to a folder like `docs/archived/` to avoid loss while improving active context clarity.

- Log the archival under `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`
- Ensure the reasons for archival are documented under `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` and `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`
