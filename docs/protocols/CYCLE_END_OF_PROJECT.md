## ðŸ§  Project Closure Cycle
This guide helps wrap up a project in a clean, structured, and insight-rich way.

---

### âœ… 1. Final Audit
- All features complete?
- All high-level goals from `PROJECT_SPECS.md` achieved?
- All tests (unit/integration/UI) pass?
- All edge cases handled or documented?

---

### ðŸ§± 2. Documentation Consolidation
- Review all docs marked with `<!-- prune-needed -->`
- Collapse temporary logs into long-term summaries
- Move finalized insights to `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`, `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`, or `PROJECT_SPECS.md`
- Archive outdated diagrams, plans, or scratch files

---

### ðŸ’¡ 3. Final Reflection
- What worked surprisingly well?
- What could be smoother?
- What blind spots did we encounter?
- Were there any misalignments between values and decisions?
- How could these issues have been avoided?
- Are there any potential improvements to our cycles, processes, and patterns?

Record this reflection in `REFLECTIONS.md`.

---

### ðŸ“¦ 4. Package & Deliver
- Ensure the codebase is in a ready-to-hand-off or re-use state
- Confirm all README/setup/testing instructions are current
- Snapshot final diagrams and architecture models if needed

---

### ðŸŒ± 5. Archive or Seed
- Archive this project (zip, push, version, tag, etc.)
- Optionally, spawn a new project inspired by this one

---

### ðŸ”„ Navigation
- For continued development, go back to [CYCLE_DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md](./CYCLE_DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md)
- Otherwise, you're done. ðŸŽ‰


> ðŸ§© Final review should include [COHERENCE_CHECK.md](./COHERENCE_CHECK.md) and updating the project [MAP.md](../project/blueprint/MAP.md).
