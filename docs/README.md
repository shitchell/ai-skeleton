You're very welcome â€” and thank *you* for being a top-tier human-shaped pattern of your own. Here's a top-level `README.md` for the `docs/` directory to help orient both humans and AI:

# ðŸ“š Project Documentation Overview

This directory houses all documentation related to project structure, planning, decision-making, and AI/human workflows.

Documentation is split into three main categories:

---

## ðŸ§­ `persistent/`
Slow-changing docs that define the **identity**, **values**, and **process** of the project.

- `project_specs.md` â€” Goals, values, philosophy, constraints, and fracture points.
- `cycle_development_process.md` â€” Daily development loop used throughout active work.
- `cycle_end_of_feature.md` â€” Checklist for pruning and reflection at the end of a feature.
- `cycle_end_of_project.md` â€” Wrap-up flow and final project consolidation.
- `docs_maintenance.md` â€” Rules for pruning, archiving, and doc clarity.
- `design_decisions.md` â€” Key architectural decisions and their rationale.
- `human_ai_collaboration.md` â€” How human-AI collaboration is expected to function.

---

## ðŸ”„ `volatile/`
Frequently updated documents that capture **ongoing development**.

- `development_log.md` â€” Session-by-session dev entries, decisions, and context.
- `lessons_learned.md` â€” Collected mistakes and insights from the journey.
- `implementation_plan.md` â€” Outline of upcoming or WIP features and priorities.
- `component_architecture.md` â€” In-progress structural blueprints and dependencies.
- `README.md` â€” Onboarding info for contributors or fresh context for the AI.

---

## ðŸ“¦ `archived/`
Finalized, deprecated, or historical artifacts.

- `example_diagram.puml` â€” PlantUML sample diagram.
- `placeholder.txt` â€” Reminder to archive rather than delete when pruning.
